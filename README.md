### Overview
New BlackArch Linux Installer is a fork of BlackArch-Installer.
It is a multifunctional version that not only fixes bugs in the existing BlackArch-Installer, but also adds new options such as installing desktop environments and setting input methods.

### New Features
- Install Desktop Environment

>> For those who find a traditional desktop manager-only environment insufficient, KDE Plasma, GNOME, and other desktop environments can be installed.

- Changes from the previous version

>> The output mode is fixed to VERBOSE and the Quiet mode has been eliminated. This is because it is more difficult to deal with errors in quiet mode.
